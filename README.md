# CORE VERTICAL — Telecom & RF

This repository defines RF and telecommunications interpretation layers for CORE.

It focuses on signal propagation, interference, and electromagnetic behavior.

## Scope
- RF propagation visualization
- Interference and noise analysis
- Spectrum coherence interpretation
- EM field behavior dashboards

## Non-Scope
- No network control
- No transmission authority
- No physics solvers
- No platform governance

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from MAGNETAR, SIGNAL, and ATMOS.

## Governance
Bound by CORE platform governance and safety constraints.
