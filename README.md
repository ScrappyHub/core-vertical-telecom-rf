# CORE VERTICAL — Telecom & RF Systems

This repository defines the Telecom & RF vertical for CORE.

It is a **field-and-signal interpretation system** for RF propagation,
interference analysis, and electromagnetic behavior across environments.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical composes:

- MAGNETAR — EM field computation, induction, material coupling
- ATMOS — air density/humidity/ionization factors affecting propagation (modeled)
- SIGNAL — spectrum analysis, correlation, coherence, anomaly metrics
- RGSR — multi-domain fusion (when combining EM with thermal/structural/acoustic inputs)

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to analyze:

- propagation and attenuation behavior across environments
- interference patterns and coherence collapse
- EM coupling into materials and structures
- RF anomalies caused by atmosphere or geometry changes
- multi-sensor RF + acoustic + vibration correlation (where declared)

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- spoofing-like interference patterns (as physics signatures, not attribution)
- storm-driven propagation shifts
- structural EM coupling (buildings, bridges, vehicles)
- underwater/shoreline boundary effects (if combined with HYDRA via governed inputs)

## What This Vertical Is

- A **telecom-grade physics interpretation layer**
- A **signal integrity and anomaly analysis system**
- A **propagation and coupling diagnostics workbench**

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not a network management system
- Not a transmission controller
- Not an attribution engine (“who did it”) without governed evidence chains

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Spectrum profile presets
- Environment/material coupling presets
- Antenna/sensor pack registry (definitions, not control)
- Interference pattern library (physics descriptors)

## Governance

High-integrity outputs only.
All access and exports are governed by CORE entitlements and audit trails.
